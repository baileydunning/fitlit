# FitLit Refactor Tractor

## Abstract

`FitLit Refactor Tractor` is a group project for Module 2 at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/). This is first and foremost a refactor project. We were given somebody else's pre-exisiting FitLit codebase. We had get the application working, build upon and refactor data file test suites, make sure all functional expectations were being met, increase accessability, switch CSS into Sass, and make the transition from using data files to server requests. We also had to incorperate chai spies and object inheritance.
